= sandbox-lsm

Simple and dirty example of "how to use LSM framework"

Real kernel requires in-tree compilation of LSM modules
(that correct since we should care about security and overrides)

In order to make your kernel 'sandspity' -- you should apply patch `export_hooks.patch`
first in order to be able to insmod your LSM modules that were compiled outside of main tree.

The module itself just 'marks' some sample points and is going to change nothing.
